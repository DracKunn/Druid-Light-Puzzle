# Druid-Light-Puzzle
a simple puzzle for a druid themed d&amp;d escape room puzzle

On a clearing in the forest, there sits a chest full of gold glinting in the light. As the party approaches, the whole clearing opens inward and forms a chute. Welcome to the jungle starts playing.
The party slides down a steep slope that is slick with lichen. Too steep to climb back up. They are in some forgotten druidic training temple. In front of them is a stone wall with a rounded doorway. Beyond the doorway is a square room 30ft by 30ft. OSn the opposite side (WEST) is another round doorway with a black metal portcullis. Left of the doorway a big lever pointing up. When the party pulls the lever, the portcullis from the entry door slams down. The room has 6 pillars. Each pillar has an animal engraved in profile: Bear, Raven, Wolf, Eagle, Raccoon, Stag. Each has a gem for its eye embedded in the rock. Each gem begins to glow as soon as the WEST lever is pulled. Once all lights are out, both portcullises open.
Touching each symbol causes certain lights to switch off/on. Each light has a different colour.
BEAR: GREEN, - bear, wolf, stag, raccoon
WOLF: RED - wolf & stag
STAG: ORANGE - stag & raccoon, wolf
RACCOON: YELLOW - raccoon
EAGLE: BLUE -  eagle, bear,  raven
RAVEN: PURPLE - raven, eagle and wolf

The lever resets the puzzle.
